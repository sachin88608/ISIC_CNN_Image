# Project Name
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- Create CNN model with custom based Architecture
- A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- Kaggle Dataset 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Build 1st Model using CNN not having Good accuracy - Underfit Model
- Build 2nd Model also not having good accuracy - Overfit Model
- Do Augmntation for handling imbalance dataset, add 500 images for each class
- Again Build Model having accuracy ----
